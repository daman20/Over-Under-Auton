## Set Up

### Installation
**All instructions must be followed IN ORDER, as each depends on the last**
First, follow these instructions to download PROS (and VS Code, if necessary): [https://pros.cs.purdue.edu/v5/getting-started/](https://pros.cs.purdue.edu/v5/getting-started/)

Then, install the specific library we are using: [https://okapilib.github.io/OkapiLib/md_docs_tutorials_walkthrough_gettingStarted.html](https://okapilib.github.io/OkapiLib/md_docs_tutorials_walkthrough_gettingStarted.html)

I would recomend connecting your GitHub account to the built in VS Code source control manager, in order to make puhsing and pulling faster:[ https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/sourcecontrol/github](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/sourcecontrol/github)
